# Stack Calculator
This is an attempt at writing a simple, yet succinct implementation of a stack-based calculator in Rust.

The aim was to make a calculator that was easily extensible, such that adding features wouldn't require any major re-writes.

## Example Usage
Example shows finding the x and y coordinates of a point 300 units from origin turned at 72&#176;.
